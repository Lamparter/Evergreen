#### What if PWAs could do more?

### ðŸ˜‡ The rant

PWAs are sacreligious. Surely you know what I'm talking about, right?

I mean, just look at this. _Horrible compact titlebar, website name in ugly bold font, along with practically terrible execution to go along with it._

This annoying menu.. with all the features of Edge... _PWAs are meant to "break the barrier between webapps and desktop apps", but instead they encourage it, with features left unmatched._ 
**This is bad design and terrible execution.**

PWAs are left with bad integration and terrible app model design.

Even a twelve year old knows better than this. "Microsoft Azure Portal (PWA)"? What the-
_Can't they just call it **Azure**_?


### ðŸ«¢ The solution

**Yes, open Spotify and start playing _O Fortuna_.**

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Evergreen: the **ULTIMATE** solution for non-crappy PWAs.
Built with love, `CommunityToolkit`, and the `WebView2` runtime, Evergreen is surely the perfect solution.

**ðŸ”¶ FluentUI** - designed with FluentUI and built on Uno Platform

**ðŸ”¶ Multitasking** - freely enable or disable tabs inside your app to allow your users to multitask with ease

**ðŸ”¶ Navigation** - easily navigate through pages without losing history or progress

**ðŸ”¶ Integration** - integrated just like the apps you know and love, making it impossible to differentiate a PWA from a desktop app

Excited enough? Let's get this PWA party started! ðŸŽ‰
